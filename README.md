# hello-world
First CIS-177 Repository

My name is **Braden Meyerhoff**. This is my first time using both _GitHub_ and _MarkDown_.  

I have been learning programming and computer information systems at [Southwestern Illinois College](https://www.swic.edu/) since 2022. 
I created this repository by following the [Hello World tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
